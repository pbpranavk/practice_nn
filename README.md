This repo contains the trimmed down version all the notebooks and resources I've gone through to practice machine learning and deep learning.

Contents of this repo are:

Prerequisites (all of them are forked from DBourke's repos):
 - Numpy Foundations
 - Pandas Foundations
 - Matplotlib Foundations
 - Tensorflow Fundamentals

All the below notebooks are forked and the sources are listed in the notebooks. I'm not a fan of writting a lot of documentation, I just like looking at code, so I haven't written much of it in this repo. However, if you want to read more about what the code does please look at the linked articles/notebooks.

 - All types Regression using Scikit as Neural nets dont perform very well with less data

 - Classification on Heart Disease data using Keras

 - CNN on MNIST using Keras

 - LSTM on IMDB dataset using keras

 - Simple RNN on Sunspot dataset using keras

 - Transfer Learning for
     - VGG16 using Keras
     - BERT using Pytorch on IMDB dataset

The motivation behind this repo was to have everything from foundations to transfer learning in one place so that I could refer it in one go. Hope you find it useful.

Bonus: If you wanted to go over opencv foundations the repo for that is here: https://github.com/pbpranavk/learn_opencv
