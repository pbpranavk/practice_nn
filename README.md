This repo contains the trimmed down version all the notebooks and resources I've gone through to practice machine learning and deep learning.

Contents of this repo are:

Prerequisites (all of the prereqs are forked from [@mrdbouke's](https://github.com/mrdbourke/) repos):

- Numpy Foundations
- Pandas Foundations
- Matplotlib Foundations
- Tensorflow Fundamentals

Neural Networks:
I went through a lot of resources to train one neural network for each of the below problems. Resources are present in each notebook which have the writeup and documentation for the code. These notebooks are just trimmed down versions of them so that I can just look at the code.

- Many types Regression using Scikit (As Neural nets dont perform very well with less data used these instead)

- Classification on Heart Disease data using Keras

- CNN on MNIST using Keras

- LSTM on IMDB dataset using keras

- Simple RNN on Sunspot dataset using keras

- Transfer Learning for
  - VGG16 using Keras
  - BERT using Pytorch on IMDB dataset

The motivation behind this repo was to have everything from foundations to transfer learning in one place so that I could refer it in one go. Hope you find it useful.

Bonus: If you wanted to go over opencv foundations the repo for that is here: https://github.com/pbpranavk/learn_opencv

Repo for learning webscraping for static and dynamic webpages: https://github.com/pbpranavk/learn_web_scraping
